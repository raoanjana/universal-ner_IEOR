Legal Proceedings\nUnited States District Court\nOn October 10, 2017, the Company received a letter from the lawyer of Eric L McRae (\u201cMcRae\u201d) a person whose association with the Company was terminated by the Company on June 16, 2017. The letter demanded payment of 850,000,000 unrestricted Tautachrome common shares to forestall his filing a laundry list of complaints in a variety of government agencies including with the US District Court in Kansas with complaints of contract breaches and fraud by silence, with the EEOC with complaints of termination by racial discrimination, with the OSHA with complains of termination for reasons of his being a whistleblower under Sarbanes-Oxley provisions, and with various regulatory agencies with accusations of an unspecified nature.\n On October 12, 2017, McRae filed a complaint, later amended twice, against the Company in the US District Court in Kansas. The amended complaint alleges 1) that the Company breached a written agreement in an alleged employment by failing to pay him 35,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and terminating his association with the Company on June 16, 2017 without proper notice. The complaint goes on to allege 2) that the Company committed fraud by silence for failing to inform him of an intent to receive the benefit of his services while harboring an intent to not compensate him, 3) that the Company breached an unwritten agreement with him to provide him with 185,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and 4) that the Company breached a convertible promissory note by failing and refusing to repay him the principal and accrued interest thereunder. Complaint number 4 is now moot in the belief of the Company since after the lawsuit was filed the Company continued to repay McRae\u2019s convertible promissory note on schedule with interest due until paid in full on October 1, 2018, thus extinguishing the note and making the matter moot. These matters remain before the Court.\n On December 12, 2017, McRae brought the Company before the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that on June 16, 2017 he was terminated from an alleged employment by the Company on the basis of race and for retaliation, and that the Company discriminated against him in the terms of this alleged employment because of race.

Legal Proceedings\nUnited States District Court\nOn October 10, 2017, the Company received a letter from the lawyer of Eric L McRae (\u201cMcRae\u201d) a person whose association with the Company was terminated by the Company on June 16, 2017. The letter demanded payment of 850,000,000 unrestricted Tautachrome common shares to forestall his filing a laundry list of complaints in a variety of government agencies including with the US District Court in Kansas with complaints of contract breaches and fraud by silence, with the EEOC with complaints of termination by racial discrimination, with the OSHA with complains of termination for reasons of his being a whistleblower under Sarbanes-Oxley provisions, and with various regulatory agencies with accusations of an unspecified nature.\n On October 12, 2017, McRae filed a complaint, later amended twice, against the Company in the US District Court in Kansas. The amended complaint alleges 1) that the Company breached a written agreement in an alleged employment by failing to pay him 35,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and terminating his association with the Company on June 16, 2017 without proper notice. The complaint goes on to allege 2) that the Company committed fraud by silence for failing to inform him of an intent to receive the benefit of his services while harboring an intent to not compensate him, 3) that the Company breached an unwritten agreement with him to provide him with 185,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and 4) that the Company breached a convertible promissory note by failing and refusing to repay him the principal and accrued interest thereunder. Complaint number 4 is now moot in the belief of the Company since after the lawsuit was filed the Company continued to repay McRae\u2019s convertible promissory note on schedule with interest due until paid in full on October 1, 2018, thus extinguishing the note and making the matter moot. These matters remain before the Court.\n On December 12, 2017, McRae brought the Company before the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that on June 16, 2017 he was terminated from an alleged employment by the Company on the basis of race and for retaliation, and that the Company discriminated against him in the terms of this alleged employment because of race. The Kansas Human Rights Commission dismissed this claim.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes commodity in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": []}]}, {"id": "NER_226", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Item 3.
